Welcome to my personal homepage! My name is Carson Sievert. I am a graduate student in the Department of [Statistics](http://www.stat.iastate.edu) at Iowa State University. I am also currently teaching [Introduction to Business Statistics](http://www.registrar.iastate.edu/catalog/2009-11/courses/stat.html#200). My interests are quickly gravitating toward statistical computing, data visualization and dynamic report generation (ie, reproducible research). I am fairly new to [R](http://www.r-project.org), but entranced by its capabilities. In fact, I am using [R-studio, knitr and Markdown](http://rstudio.org/docs/authoring/using_markdown) to create most (if not all) of this website. Besides golf and guiness, I like a good short cut and pretty things. Any [shameless promotion](github.com/cpsievert/) is my own.
