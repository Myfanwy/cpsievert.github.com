Rough Outline
========================================================

* __GOAL:__ Estimate an unknown value via sampling
* The unknown value usually refers to the population parameter ($\mu$)
* In order to estimate $\mu$, we commonly sample (or take a subset) from the population of interest. Certain sampling methods can introduce bias. We want an __unbiased__ estimate of $\mu$. 
* Lots of different ways to sample, some are better than others. We cover five different methods.

Sampling Schemes
========================================================

* Simple Random Sample (most common - typically no bias)
* Stratified Random Sample (less common - typically no bias)
* Cluster Sampling (common in geographic studies - typically no bias)
* Voluntary Response (quite common - quite terrible - usually biased)
* Convenience Sampling (quite common - quite terrible - usually biased)
