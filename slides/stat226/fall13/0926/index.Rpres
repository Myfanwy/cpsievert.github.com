Histogram of hits per game in baseball
========================================================

```{r hit_dens, echo=FALSE}
all.hits <- read.csv("hits.csv", header=TRUE)
hits <- c(all.hits[,1], all.hits[,2])
hist(hits, freq=FALSE, xlim=c(0, 25), xlab="hits/game", main="")
```
***

* Pretty close to a symmetric, bell-shaped distribution. Let's fit a normal distribution to it!

Fitting a normal distribution to data
========================================================

```{r hit_dens2, echo=FALSE}
hist(hits, freq=FALSE, xlim=c(0, 25), xlab="hits/game", main="")
mn <- mean(hits, na.rm=TRUE)
s <- sqrt(var(hits, na.rm=TRUE))
x <- seq(0, 25, .1)
y <- dnorm(x, mean=mn, sd=s)
lines(x, y)
abline(v=mn, col=2)
```
***

* We can fit a normal distribution to this data by:
  * setting the mean parameter $\mu$ equal to the sample mean $\bar{x}$ = `r mn`
  * setting the variance parameter $\sigma^2$ equal to the sample variance $s^2$  = `r s`
  
  
Making approximate inference with empirical rule
========================================================

```{r hit_dens3, echo=FALSE}
hist(hits, freq=FALSE, xlim=c(0, 25), xlab="hits/game", main="")
lines(x, y)
abline(v=mn-s, col=3)
abline(v=mn+s, col=3)
mn <- round(mn, 2)
s <- round(s, 2)
```

***

* The empirical rule tells us about 68% of the normal curve falls within one standard deviation of the mean.
* Note that the mean is `r mn` and the standard deviation is `r s`.
* If we were to pick __one__ random game, there is roughly a 68% chance of there being between  (`r mn` - `r s`, `r mn` + `r s`) => (`r mn - s`, `r mn + s`) hits in that game.

Is runs per game really normally distributed??
========================================================

```{r qqnorm, echo=FALSE}
qqnorm(hits)
qqline(hits, col=2)
```
***
* If runs/game was _perfectly_ normal, the points would fall _exactly_ on the red line.
* Since nothing is _perfectly_ normal, we expect _some_ deviation from this line.
* The real question is whether this deviation is _significant_. If the deviation is _significant_, the distribution of runs/game is probably not normal.
* Suppose the deviation here is significant. What does that imply?
