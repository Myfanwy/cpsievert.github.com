Announcements
========================================================

* Homework 1 is now available on Blackboard and is due next week Thursday.
* Quiz 1 will be available on Blackboard next Thursday.
  * Note you'll want access to the textbook for quizzes...
* My office hours will be on Mondays at 2:10-4pm in Snedecor 1205/1207.
  * Except for this upcoming Monday...
  * The full office hours schedule should be finalized by the end of the week.
* Any questions about the syllabus, Chapter 1 or Chapter 2?
  * I don't want to focus too much on Chapters 1-4...things will get much harder!

K-Packs Example
========================================================
title:false

* __Question__: How much should KPacks charge for their backpack? More specifically, what is the average amount potential customers are willing to spend?
* __Population__:
  * Potential customers.
* __Sample__:
  * Fall 2013 STAT 226 section D students (in your case...your neighbors).
* __Parameter__:
  * The __average (or mean)__ amount potential customers are willing to pay.
* __Statistic__:
  * The __average (or mean)__ amount fall 2013 STAT 226 section D students (in your case...your neighbors) are willing to pay.
  
Stepping Back...
========================================================

* What is the __variable__ of interest?
* Is this variable __quantitative__ or __categorical__?
  * Is the number of possible values for this variable large (> 50)?
  * If it is, then it is probably __quantitative__.
  * If not, then it is probably __categorical__.
* This handout gives you practice with identifying the difference...
  
Digging Deeper...
========================================================

* A population and sample _could_ be any size that you wish...it really all depends on your question of interest.
  * However, your sample _must_ be a smaller than your population.
  * Technically speaking, your sample has to be a subset of your population.
  * Is this the case for the KPacks example???
  * Well, that probably depends on your definition of potential customer...
  * Even if everyone here is a potential customer, would this class be a _good_ representation of all potential customers?
  * No, this is a case of __convenience__ sampling. The __statistic__ is probably not a good estimate of the __parameter__!
  
One more example
========================================================
title:false

* __Question__: What will be the average runs per game scored by the Chicago Cubs during the 2013 season?
* __Population__:
  * There isn't one (I can't observe games in the future)!
* __Process__:
  * The Cubs could be viewed as a __system__ and the average runs per game is a __component (or process)__ of that system.
  * Future games would be __inputs__ to the system and past games would be __outputs__.
* __Sample__:
  * Every game played by the Cubs in 2013 thus far.
* __Statistic__:
  * The average runs per game scored by the Chicago Cubs so far this season.

Processes
========================================================
incremental: false

* Fundamental to many business decisions. For example, monthly sales at company X is a process.
* Predicting something like annual sales can be incredibly difficult. In stat 326, you'll learn how to do this.

Time Series Data
========================================================
title: false

* The graphic below contains a similar __time series__ data on monthly sales. What's the difference?

* Is one better than the other?

* Sometimes quality is a matter of preference. But, there are definitely good graphics and bad ones.

Data Visualization
========================================================

There is more than one way to represent the same [data](http://www.nanocubes.net/view.html).

What's a 226 student to do?
========================================================

1. Identify the __variable__ of interest.
2. Identify whether the variable is __categorical__ or __quantitative__.
3. If variable is __categorical__ (chapter 3), you're options are:
  * __Bar chart__ (recommended)
  * __Pareto chart__ (recommended)
  * __Pie chart__ (not recommended)
4. If variable is __quantitative__ (chapter 4), you're options are:
  * <div title="distribution of a variable is the collection of possible values the
variable can take and how often each value occurs." style="float:left;clear:both;">__Histogram__ (good for examining a single __distribution__)</div>
  * __Boxplot__ (good for comparing multiple __distributions__)
