## Rough Outline

#### **GOAL: Estimate an unknown value via sampling**
<p></p>
#### * The unknown value is commonly called a population parameter ($\mu$)
<p></p>
#### * In order to estimate $\mu$, we commonly sample (or take a subset) from the population of interest. Certain sampling methods can introduce bias. We want an _unbiased_ estimate of $\mu$. 
<p></p>
#### * Lots of different ways to sample, some are better than others. We cover five different methods.
<p></p>
* Simple Random Sample (most common - typically no bias)

* Stratified Random Sample (less common - typically no bias)

* Cluster Sampling (common in geographic studies - typically no bias)

* Voluntary Response (quite common - quite terrible - usually biased)

* Convenience Sampling (quite common - quite terrible - usually biased)
