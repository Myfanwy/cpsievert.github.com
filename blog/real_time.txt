I recently gave a talk at the Statistical Graphics Group here at Iowa State. It was a shameless self-promotion of my R package, pitchRx, that makes Major League Baseball's PITCHf/x data easier to work obtain and analyze. People seemed pretty enthralled with the real-time animations I put in my presentation, so I thought I would give a tutorial on recreating them. 

First of all, make sure you have R (version 2.15.1 or newer), R-studio and pandoc installed on your machine. The real_time.Rmd file (R Markdown) file used to produce the demo does depend on several R packages, so make sure you have these packages installed before "knitting" this file:

devotees
knitr
R2SWF

Once these packages are installed, make sure you have a internet connection then click on the "Knit HTML" feature in R-studio. Once the knitting process has finished, this creates both a markdown and HTML file in your working directory. After these files are created, open your command-line interface and:

(1) Mimic your current directory to the same directory you are using in R-studio
(2) Enter the following command: pandoc -s -S -i -t dzslides real_time.md -o real_time.html

Now open real_time.html in a web browser. Volia! Note that I haven't tested this in any browser other than google chrome.

You can easily customize this code to animate any set of pitches that you might be interested in. Just edit the appropriate dates and player(s) in scrapeFX and subset the FX data frame according to which pitch types you want! Its that easy!
