There has been a lot of hype recently surrounding web based graphics. One project I'm excited about
is `rcharts`. Here is a basic demo of it's capabilities:

```{r load}
library(devtools)
install_github('rCharts', 'ramnathv')
```

```{r chart1}
require(rCharts)
names(iris) = gsub("\\.", "", names(iris))
p1 <- rPlot(SepalLength ~ SepalWidth | Species, data = iris, color = "Species",
    type = "point")
#p1$addParams(width = 550)
#p1$printChart("chart1")
return(p1)
```
